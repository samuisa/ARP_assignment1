# ARP_assignment1
This project implements a simulation of a drone moving in a 2D environment.

The architecture is composed of 5 separate processes that communicate using pipes. These processes manage the overall logic, user input, the drone itself, obstacles, and targets within the 2D environment. The communication is managed by the main process, which creates the pipes and the child processes.

Architecture and Processes

MAIN --> This process handles initialization, creation of the pipes and the child processes, and waits for the termination of all processes.

I processi:

![Processes Architecture](/images/SketchARP.png)

WINDOW --> This process acts as the system's blackboard and server. It uses select() to simultaneously monitor the various pipes connected to the other processes. 

Initialization: Configures the ncurses environment and sends the window dimensions to the other processes.

Visualization Update: Updates the display of the drone (+ symbol) when it receives a new position from the drone process.

Obstacles/Targets: Updates the visualization of obstacles and targets, and forwards their positions to the drone process.

INPUT --> This process displays a non-interactive ncurses legend detailing the keys the user can press. It captures the user's keystrokes and sends them to the blackboard process.

DRONE --> The drone process calculates its new position based on:

Its internal dynamics.

Manual forces sent by the user input.

Repulsive force generated by obstacles and environment borders.

Finally, it sends its updated position to the blackboard process.

OBSTACLES --> This process generates a matrix of fixed obstacles based on a percentage of the window dimensions and sends this matrix to the blackboard process.

TARGETS --> This process generates the targets in the same manner as obstacles, ensuring they do not overlap with obstacles or borders, and sends them to the blackboar process.

Additioinal Features
A log file has been created to record system activities.
